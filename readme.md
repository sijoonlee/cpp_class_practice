## C++ Class Practice  
Constructor  
Copy Constructor  
Assignment Operator Overloading (Copy)  
Stream Insertion Operator Overloading (<<)  
  
## Compile  
`g++ -std="c++17" main.cpp`  

## Run  
`./a.out`  

## Output  
```
directory_x instantiated
Two data added into directory_x
Jone Doe 111 1 James Brown 222 2 
111
showPhoneOffice called
2getNoEmployees() called
wirteDirecotry() called, written into output_a.text
Phone array declared and initialized with 2 dataset
directory_y instanciated with Phone array
directory_y : 
Mountain 333 3 River 444 4 
Copy assignment operator called, directory_x = directory_y
directory_x : 
Mountain 333 3 River 444 4 
directory_z is instanciated by copy constructor, directory_y used : 
directory_z : 
Mountain 333 3 River 444 4 
```
